\begin{abstract}
All data are at some point present in memory, but this paper examines what traces of communication survives in memory after the application is closed down. To examine this an Android phone was filled with some of the most used communication applications on the market, and engaged in communications through these. It was then rooted without a reboot and connected to a computer for memory extraction. A market top-selling cleaning tool was also downloaded and ran between data creation and extraction to do as much as a every-day user could practically do to remove communication traces from memory.
