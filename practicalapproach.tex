\section{Practical Application}
%\lipsum[1-2]
We wanted to find remaining traces in memory from communication data and application metadata. For this we used the phone Sony Xperia M2 with Android 5.1.1.

\subsection{Laboratory Environment}
The phone was factory reset to ensure a reproducible result. At this point the phone was rooted %TODO: Explain term
using the KingRoot application version 4.9.5. This process did not require restart of the phone, potentially leaving traces of memory from before rooting and making it ideal for memory forensics provided the phone can be unlocked regardless of root status. After testing the root, the phone was restarted to ensure a consistent state. As part of this process ADB USB debugging was enabled.

Several applications was installed for testing. The applications installed were:
\begin{description}
\item[Facebook]
\item[Facebook Messenger]
\item[Snapchat]
\item[WhatsApp]
\item[Jodle]
\item[Google Apps] \hfill\\Preinstalled on the phone, including GMail, Maps and Chrome
\end{description}
Since this was performed after rooting of the phone, testing of remains in memory when rooting was impossible.

\subsubsection{Extracting memory}
To extract the memory AMExtract was chosen. %TODO: REF
 It did not have a profile for the phone %TODO: name
 , so a profile for extraction method, size of %TODO: name of buffer
 and other properties was created and tested.
 
 The tool was then compiled using the ndk-build tool. As part of the linux kernel headers has been modified, one of the types had to be redefined using an older header file.

\subsubsection{Searching memory}
The extracted memory was searched using the strings which was previously entered. For this purpose the 'strings' tool was used to extract continuous regions of ASCII text and 'grep' was used to search in this text. This has the disadvantage of only finding continuous buffers using simple storage mechanisms, but is quick to execute.

\subsubsection{Carving memory}
To find other types of resources a simple file carving was attempted using %TODO: name of tool(scappy?) Check anti-forensics repo
with matches for the following file types:
\begin{itemize}
	\item PNG
	\item JPG
	\item TIFF
\end{itemize}
%TODO: Put results of carving in results!
